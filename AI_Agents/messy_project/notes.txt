Notes for the replication package
=================================

DATA:
- 1_experiment_clean.dta = main experimental data (waves 1-3), 1043 obs
- 2_nextofkin_clean.dta = next of kin experiment (MTurk), 803 obs
- 3_dmv_quarterly_clean.dta = state DMV registration rates, 1416 obs
- dmv_quarterly_raw.csv = raw version (quarterly data by state)
- nextofkin_raw.csv = raw NOK data from Qualtrics

STATA CODE (original):
- see original .do files from Kessler & Roth
- we're converting everything to R

ISSUES:
- Table1_descriptive.R still has hardcoded path — fix later
- "make figs.R" has a space in the name... should rename
- old_robustness_checks.R — not sure which checks to keep
- quick_look.R — delete before submission
- Need to figure out stacked DiD for column 7 of Table 3
- Event study figure looks weird for Hawaii — check data gap

TODO:
- Write README (lol)
- Add LICENSE file
- Create master script
- Package versions??? what are we using?
- Check: does the NOK confidence index match Stata output?
- Tennessee dropped from DMV analysis — document why
