It provides a graphical interface and handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news for students and educators\n\n\n\nDocker Desktop is free for educational use. Docker’s subscription terms explicitly exempt educational institutions, so you can use Docker Desktop at university without any licensing concerns.\n\n\n WindowsWindows (with Docker Desktop)\nPrerequisites: Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, or\nWindows 11. You need administrator access.\nStep 1: Enable WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for\nLinux)\nWSL 2 lets Docker run a lightweight Linux kernel inside Windows. This\nis required.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator (right-click the\nStart button, select “Terminal (Admin)” or “Windows PowerShell\n(Admin)”)\nRun:\n\nwsl --install\n\nRestart your computer when prompted\nAfter restart, a window will open asking you to create a Linux\nusername and password. Choose something simple you will remember (e.g.,\nyour first name as username). This is NOT your Windows\npassword — it is a new, separate password for the Linux\nsubsystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected time: 5–10 minutes (including restart)\n\n\nStep 2: Install Docker Desktop\n\nGo to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\nClick “Download for Windows”\nRun the downloaded installer\n(Docker Desktop Installer.exe)\nKeep all default settings and click through the installer\nWhen installation finishes, restart your computer\nif prompted\nDocker Desktop should start automatically after login.

    "text": "2.3 Option B: Docker Engine in WSL 2 Without Docker Desktop (Windows Only)\nIf you prefer a lightweight, CLI-only setup — or if you want to avoid Docker Desktop entirely — you can install Docker Engine directly inside a WSL 2 Linux distribution. This is the most common Docker Desktop-free approach on Windows. You get the full docker and docker compose commands, but without the graphical interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to choose this option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are comfortable working in a terminal and do not need a GUI\nYou want a smaller footprint (no background Desktop app running)\nYou are on a shared or restricted machine where installing Docker Desktop is not possible\n\nTrade-offs: You lose the Docker Desktop GUI and some convenience features (like automatic WSL integration across multiple distros, one-click resource settings, and the visual container dashboard). Functionally, however, everything works the same.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Enable and Install WSL 2\nIf you have not already installed WSL 2, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:\nwsl --install\nRestart your computer when prompted. After restart, a window will ask you to create a Linux username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected time: 5–10 minutes (including restart)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Open Your WSL 2 Ubuntu Terminal\nOpen Ubuntu from the Start menu. All the following commands are run inside this Linux terminal.\nStep 3: Install Docker Engine\nFollow the official Docker Engine installation steps for Ubuntu. Run these commands one by one:\n# Update package index and install prerequisites\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl\n\n# Add Docker's official GPG key\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\nsudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \\\n  -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc\nsudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc\n\n# Add Docker's repository\necho \\\n  \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \\\n  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | \\\n  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null\n\n# Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose plugin\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \\\n  docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected time: 5–10 minutes\n\n\n\nStep 4: Start the Docker Daemon\nWSL 2 does not use systemd by default, so Docker does not start automatically. You need to start it manually:\nsudo service docker start\nYou will need to run this command every time you open a new WSL terminal session (or after a reboot). To make it start automatically, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:\necho 'sudo service docker start' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid the sudo password prompt\n\n\n\nTo avoid the sudo password prompt every time Docker starts, you can add your user to the docker group:\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\nThen close and re-open your Ubuntu terminal for the change to take effect. After that, you can run docker commands without sudo.\n\n\nStep 5: Verify the Installation\ndocker --version\ndocker run hello-world\nYou should see Docker version 27.x.x and then Hello from Docker!. If so, Docker Engine is working inside your WSL 2 environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFrom here, everything else in this guide works the same — all docker buildx build, docker compose, and docker run commands work identically whether you use Docker Desktop or Docker Engine in WSL 2."

You will need:\n\nThe Stata installer file (e.g., Stata18Linux64.tar.gz) — ask your IT department\nYour license information (serial number, code, authorization)\n\n# Copy the Stata installer into the container\nCOPY Stata18Linux64.tar.gz /tmp/\nRUN cd /tmp && tar -xzf Stata18Linux64.tar.gz && \\\n    cd /tmp/Stata18 && ./install\n\n# You will need to initialize the license separately after the container starts:\n# Inside the container, run: stata -q -e \"exit\"\n# and enter your license details when prompted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nStata for Linux is different from Stata for Windows/Mac. Even if you have Stata on your laptop, you need a Linux version for the Docker container. Some university licenses include all platforms.\n\n\nOption B: Mount Stata from your host system\nIf you have Stata installed on your Mac/Windows machine, you can “share” it into the container using a Docker volume. This is more complex and depends on your specific Stata installation path.\nOption C: Skip Stata and use R equivalents\nFor many econometric analyses, R packages like fixest, plm, ivreg, and rdrobust can replicate Stata functionality. The workshop’s CLAUDE.md includes a complete Stata-to-R mapping table for this purpose. This is the easiest option if you do not have a Linux Stata license."

You can move\nthis to a different drive:\nStep 1: Stop Docker Desktop (right-click the whale\nicon in the system tray, select “Quit Docker Desktop”)\nStep 2: Open PowerShell as Administrator:\n# Stop WSL\nwsl --shutdown\n\n# Export the Docker data distribution to your target drive\nwsl --export docker-desktop-data D:\\DockerData\\docker-desktop-data.tar\n\n# Unregister the original (this removes it from your C: drive)\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop-data\n\n# Import it at the new location with a size you control\nwsl --import docker-desktop-data D:\\DockerData D:\\DockerData\\docker-desktop-data.tar\n\n# Clean up the export file\ndel D:\\DockerData\\docker-desktop-data.tar\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected time: 5–15 minutes depending on how much\nDocker data you already have.\nReplace D:\\DockerData with any folder on a drive with\nenough space. If you have an external SSD or a second internal drive,\nuse that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent versions of Docker Desktop (4.30+) may no longer create a\nseparate docker-desktop-data WSL distribution. If the\nwsl --export docker-desktop-data command fails, use Docker\nDesktop’s built-in setting instead: Settings → Resources → Disk\nimage location and move the storage from there.\n\n\nStep 3: Restart Docker Desktop. All Docker\noperations now use the new location.\n MacMac\nOn Mac, Docker Desktop stores its data in a single disk image file.\nYou can control its location and size:\n\nOpen Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Disk image\nlocation\nClick “Browse” and select a folder on a different\nvolume or external drive\nSet the “Disk image size” to your desired limit\n(e.g., 60 GB)\nClick “Apply & restart”\n\nDocker will move its data to the new location. This may take a few\nminutes."

    "text": "14.3 Option B: Create a Dedicated Disk Image (Advanced — Maximum Isolation)\nThis approach creates a fixed-size virtual disk that Docker uses. When it fills up, Docker hits a wall but your system stays safe. This is ideal for running AI agents that you want to constrain strictly.\n WindowsWindows (WSL 2)\nOn Windows, Docker runs inside WSL 2, which already uses a virtual\ndisk (.vhdx file). You can control its maximum size:\nStep 1: Stop Docker Desktop and WSL:\nwsl --shutdown\nStep 2: Create a .wslconfig file in\nyour Windows home directory (C:\\Users\\YourName\\.wslconfig)\nwith:\n[wsl2]\n# Limit WSL 2 resource usage\nmemory=8GB\nprocessors=4\nswap=0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis .wslconfig file limits WSL 2’s memory and CPU usage\nbut does not directly cap the virtual disk size. The\nvirtual disk (ext4.vhdx) grows dynamically up to 256 GB by\ndefault. To shrink an existing one, you need to use\ndiskpart in PowerShell — this is more complex and not\nnecessary for a fresh setup. For hard disk limits on Windows, use Option\nA (move Docker storage to a drive with limited free space) instead.\n\n\nStep 3: Restart WSL and Docker Desktop.\n MacMac\nOn Mac, you can create a dedicated APFS or HFS+ disk image:\nStep 1: Open Disk Utility\n(Spotlight: Cmd+Space, type “Disk Utility”)\nStep 2: Go to File → New Image → Blank\nImage and configure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\nValue\n\n\n\n\nName\nDockerWorkspace\n\n\nSize\n60 GB (or your preferred limit)\n\n\nFormat\nAPFS\n\n\nPartitions\nSingle partition - GUID\n\n\nImage Format\nsparse disk image (grows as needed, up to the size limit)\n\n\n\nStep 3: Click “Save”. The disk\nimage (.sparseimage) will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected time: &lt; 1 minute\n\n\nStep 4: Double-click the .sparseimage\nfile to mount it. It appears as a drive in Finder (e.g.,\n/Volumes/DockerWorkspace).\nStep 5: Point Docker Desktop to this location:\n\nOpen Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Disk image\nlocation\nSet it to /Volumes/DockerWorkspace\nClick “Apply & restart”\n\nStep 6: After every reboot, double-click the\n.sparseimage file to mount it before starting Docker\nDesktop. Or automate it by adding it to your Login Items (System\nSettings → General → Login Items → add the .sparseimage\nfile)."
